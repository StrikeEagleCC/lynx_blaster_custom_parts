## Notch Drill Guide
The notch drill guide is used to drill the notches in the end of the<br>
long aluminum bars. Press a 3/16" drill bushing into the top and some M5<br>
heat-set inserts into the bottom. Place the bars in the jig, and fasten<br>
the top down with M5x16 screws before drilling through.

## Drill Marking Guides 1, 2, & 3
These marking guides are intended to be used with a 5/32" or 4mm<br>
transfer punch to mark the drill locations for all the threaded and<br>
clearance holes on the various aluminum bars.
